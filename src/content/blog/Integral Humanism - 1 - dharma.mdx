# Dharma

{/* Why learn about Dharma section */}
Why learn about Dharma?
Truth resides with Dharma. Today, when talking about blockhain systems, we tend to talk about them as "trustless" or "trust machines". However, trust has something to do with truth and truth resides with Dharma.

What is Dharma?

> It is true that the king wielded a great deal of influence, and that he was a protector of Dharma in society, but the king could not decide what constitutes Dharma. He only saw to it that people led their lives according to Dharma. In a way, he was equivalent to the present-day executive. - Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay

In this article, I wish to explore the concept of Dharma as written in the Integral Humanism lectures in present day terms and how they are relevant in technologies like Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence in achieving certain economic goals such as Decentralisation and Swadeshi.
